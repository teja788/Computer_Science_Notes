# Introduction

* C is a programming language developed by Dennis Ritche in 1972.It is reliable, simple easy to use.
* C has been used since 30 years despite popularity of other programs because it is easy to write memory efficent programs.

# Basic building blocks

* **Constant** is a entity which doesn't change. **Variable** is a entity which changes.

## Constants
* Types of Constants:
  * Primary Constants
    * Integer Constant
    * Real Constant
    * Character Constant
  * Secondary Constants
    * Array
    * Pointer
    * Structer
    * Union
    * Enum
* Rules for constructing integer constants
  * Must have atleast one digit
  * Must not have decimal
  * Either positive or negative
  * If no sign assumed as positive
  * no commas or blanks allowed
  * allowable range on 16-bit compiler -32768 to +32767
* Rules of real constants
  * Must have atleast one digit
  * Must have decimal point
  * could be positive or negative. Defualt sign is +ve
  * No commas or blanks allowed
* Real costant can be written in exponential or fractational form. Exponential form is used if constant is too large
* In exponential form two parts are present. part before "e" is called mantisaa, part following "e" is called exponent.
* Rules of real constants expressed in exponential form:
  * Mantissa and exponential form seperated by "e"
  * Default sign of mantisa is +ve.
  * exponent must have atlest one digit and can be +ve or -ve. deafult sign is positive
  * range is -3.4e38 to 3.4e38
* Rules for Character constants:
  * Single alphabet, digit or symbol enclosed in single inverted commas ex: 'A'
  * maximum length is 1.
